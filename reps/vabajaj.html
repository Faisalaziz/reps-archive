I am a Mozilla Reps from 2014, i have also contributed in community building and evangelism. My area of interest is to teach what i learn. In 2016, i got opportunity to serve Mozilla campus Clubs and Mozilla Clubs as a regional coordinator. And then i got the opportunity to serve as a Mozilla Reps Mentor to the new reps batch.
I hearlty love to guide new Mozillians, new reps and Cub captains when they are confused in this open source world. I always love to talk about the path they should choose to be a part of this open source world.  <br/><br/> Currently i am a Reps mentor, Regional Coordinator and a Resource Reps.
