      <td>Nirmal and Bansaj were involved with translation of Firefox even before I was appointed as a Rep. But We can count them as new recruits too because I had inspired them to work on it.

Also, one of my friend&#39;s office ( StrongCode Labs) is interested in developing a Nepali Spell Checker addon for Firefox. I have talked about it to my mentor and got some informations on it. Will post updates about it.</td>
