1. A graphic showing prevention methods, acronymed by the WHO as WEFDF
W - Wash your hands for 20 secs
E - Sneeze in your elbow
F - Don&#39;t touch your face, eyes or nose before washing hands
D - Maintain 6 ft distance
F - Pay attention to how you feel

2. Suggested to take advantage of webex as they are offering free collab software amidst the crisis.</td>

      <td>- I participated in Privacy Month 2020 where I took the responsibility of deciding a topic of the day and documenting a tip for it. The tip also consisted of a supporting link that gave detailed information about that topic.
- For deciding the topics, I put in reasonable amount of research to make sure that the topics remain current and relevant that the audience could relate to. For example, in 2019 the number of credit card skimming cases have gone up significantly so a topic was added to spread awareness about it. Another good example is people getting duped into giving up their UPI pin, so a topic on better opsec and phishing awareness was added.
- I worked with Vishal Chavan and Chandan Baba during this campaign.</td>
