I agreed and promised that we would organize a Firefox OS App days in addition to the webmaker party event (which fits better to the expected audience). I also gathered a few developers who promised to come and develop apps.</td>

Over 200 people are working together easily because they share the same language, and they are contributing more and more. But sometimes, it&#39;s hard because of the distance, and because of the jet lag. So this event would be a fantastic way to share our knowledge, and to prepare the future events in these 15 countries, IRL. We would also work together on MDN, Webmaker, and of course, Firefox OS! </td>
