<h1>Srushtika Neelakantam</h1>

<table>
  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I'm an undergrad student currently in my final year. I've previously interned as an android developer and a web developer at two different  startups. 

I'm a Tech-Speaker at Mozilla and love speaking and advocating new technologies that could change the way we spend our lives. 

I actively advocate for an open web and have been a volunteer at Mozilla since 3 years, where I teach the web to the people in my region.

I wish to reach out to a greater audience to share my tech knowledge and also learn new things from people connected to me.</td></tr>

Some are friendly sites, but others put users at risk of getting old editions, a bad experience or even malicious installs.</td>
