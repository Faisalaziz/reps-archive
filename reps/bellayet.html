      <td>Firefox OS successfully lunched in Bangladesh. Already lots of local apps and content available at Firefox Marketplace. And the number of apps are growing. But we noticed the available apps does not looks good and attractive because of bad UI&#x2F;UX design of the apps. The main reason is, lack of enough knowledge and capacity of UI&#x2F;UX design of the developers. To increase the awareness and capacity of developers on UI&#x2F;UX for Firefox OS apps we planned this event.</td>
