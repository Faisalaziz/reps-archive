We (myself and Mozillian Divambal) gave some demo on what they can do with Webmaker and then launch the party. All the three groups have been able to remix at one make using Thimble and Popcorn.

      <td>20-24 Jan 2014: Mozilla at FOSS Workshop

I was involved in this one-week FOSS workshop for lecturers and academics staff of the University of Technology Mauritius. Although this event was not organise by Mozilla, but as a Mozilla Reps I participated as a facilitator. The workshop is about the scientific writing and how to publish an article online. Firefox has been used as the main browser as interface to do server installation and management of OJS - the application that was used for this workshop.</td>

Meeting with organisation: the &#39;Jeune Chambre International&#39; has made a request for Mozilla Tour for its members. This activity is scheduled for the mid-July.

As a Mozilla Reps in Mauritius, I wish to create a very strong Mozilla Community especially among the young. In doing so, I am looking forward to create a facebook page for Mozilla-Mauritius and make a request to Council Reps for a domain and hosting of website for [www.mozilla-mauritius.org]. In addition, I am also planning to hold ‘Mozilla Summer Code Party’ for students in some high schools of Mauritius in the beginning of August. The main objective of this event is to encourage students to develop their ability and  knowledge in coding skills and creation of websites.
