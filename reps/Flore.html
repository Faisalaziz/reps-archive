<h1>Flore Allemandou</h1>

  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>Working in medical research (first in fundamental research, then in clinical trials), I'm in no way a code or a techie. But I'm kinda geek and was pulled into Mozilla by my boyfriend in 2003. I attended several events (FOSDEM in Brussels, parties in Paris) met other contributors. There is a FLOSS event in Lyon every year and the more mozillians come, the happier I get... It's great to have 10 or 20 friends talking, laughing, sharing their thoughts, laughing... That's the best part of Mozilla for me!
I also have 2 little kids (July 2009 and November 2011)...</td></tr>
