  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>Joined Mozilla Program  in Feb 2014.
Organized  in  6 FoxYeah Event.
Contributed in  Hindi Localization
Gave talks in  10-12 events in  different Colleges.
Participated in  MOzStumbler Project.
Help in founding  of Mozilla Himachal and MozPacers communities.
arranged two meetups where we had guest like Sara George Roter, Haghdoosti and  Jochai Ben-Avie. Around 50 mozillians attended these events.

Celebrated 10th Birthday of Firefox in Rohtang , video was selected as one of the best video all around the world and is in the Main Firefox Video of CELEBRATION all  around the world.


As a mentor 

Students need guidance and leader who can  help them  to guide and motivate them where  and how to contribute.Thats the reason we have very strong active contributors team  in delhi NCR .Sometimes it has happened that we had to organize events at very short interval of time where swags or funds were not available.still we managed to support the events and mozllains there.
I like to talk to students about their challenges and educate them as i think a Rep should be first good mentor and team player.


As a contributor 

i can contribute with my camera to capture sessions or events.
i have  contributed  in  hindi localisation, thimble , popcorn and stumbling and FoxYeah events too
because public speaking and people interaction are my passion so i am  a good speaker.
i like to manage people and events.


Pages/Blogs I manage about Mozilla:-

I also drive or manage Youtube and FB  link of MOzilla Delhi community.</td></tr>
