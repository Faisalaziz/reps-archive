So i engaged myself for developing &quot;Kabbo&quot;, a collection of 100+ Bengali poems apps. This December the apps published in Firefox marketplace. Initially there are some basic features like platform independent, offline usability, compatible in all Firefox, poem search option and so on.

Now based on the feedback from the users, working on the next version update of the apps.</td>
