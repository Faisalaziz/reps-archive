 event related to Fedora figured it would be a good idea.

My talk on Mozilla Thunderbird in Fedora, My metodolgy Define and explain from the beginning, because there were users who did not know about Mozilla Thunderbird and others that if knowing, I explain that it is an account manager email Free developed by the Mozilla Foundation, with many new resources, some of which did not know I had Thunderbird,for example the new built-in chat, and post filters, about which protocols very interesting, that really struck and I enjoyed the interest of the people attending.

After installing Thunderbird present as if it came in its Linux operating system from a terminal run yum -y install thunderbird once downloaded all the packages to install Thunderbird, Present some 
of the best manager email characteristics, I liked the presentation and asked them questions or support community visiting our Facebook site , source me very well and have not had stage fright jejejeje.

I hope to continue growing in my exhibitions, and improving every day.</td>
