Dear Mozilla Reps Mentees,

it&#39;s been a too long time since my last check-in with you. Unfortunately this serves as an example for one of the Reps program&#39;s biggest weaknesses: Level of activity among Mozilla Reps.

Mozilla is a huge organization requiring a broad spectrum of activities from its contributors. While the Reps program is certainly not perfectly suited for everybody, I am sure there is a spot for anybody to contribute to Mozilla&#39;s goals and mission.

This email is a heads-up for the &quot;Activity Campaign&quot; which will be kicked-off soon. The campaign aims at separating active Mozilla Reps from inactive ones, potentially re-activating dormant Reps. Those who are found to be inactive by the time the campaign ends will be moved to the Reps Alumni group (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reps.mozilla.org&#x2F;people&#x2F;alumni&#x2F;).

Personally, I welcome this initiative. It serves as a way to figure out who is still willing and able to contribute towards the program&#39;s goals.

Please watch out for the official announcements of the Activity Campaign and do not hesitate to contact me in case you have any questions.

Best regards,

Hugo - Mozilla Reps Mentor

      <td>From 15 to 19 October this year, held the XIX National Congress of Computer Science (CCBOL 2012) in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. This event is held each year nationwide and aims to provide new knowledge in the technology area to students of universities in Bolivia.
Mozilla Bolivia was an important part of this great event and we were able to make two presentations, the first called &quot;Mozilla, present and future on the network&quot;, where we could show in detail what is Mozilla, Mozilla community and especially the projects and philosophy that follows.
The second presentation was &quot;Developing Firefox OS&quot; where we show the importance of a free and open mobile platform, with current standards and enables easier development of applications. This helped many be more interested in learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to develop applications for Firefox OS.
I was also invited as Mozilla Reps to be on the jury of the &quot;Software Contest in CCBOL 2012,&quot; this participation earned recognition from the organizers to the Mozilla community.

I have participated in the event called TECHNOSUR, held in the city of Asuncion in Paraguay, to show the work done with the translation of Firefox to the Guarani language.</td>
