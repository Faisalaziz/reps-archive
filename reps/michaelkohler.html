<h1>Michael Kohler</h1>

<table>
  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>Since November 2012 I am a Mozilla Rep, building communities in Berlin (since April 2018) and I've helped building the "Mozilla Switzerland" community in the past before moving to Berlin. Further, I am deeply involved in strategic questions around Participation/Open Innovation. I am also helping developing the Reps Portal as well as other Open Innovation projects.


Office hours
--------

I'm using an IRC bouncer. That means that I'm online 24/7. Just ping me if you want to discuss anything Mozilla related. I will respond as quickly as possible. You can also ping me to schedule a meeting for a requested time slot. Additionally you can also write a mail to the email address listed here or on Telegram. I'll respond as quickly as possible. Usually this will be within a few hours.</td></tr>

Now Mario (Rep and organizer) just handed out free tickets for Mozillians and would be able to sponsor 200€ for the flight costs. WIth that we would have about 50€-100€ costs on our side.
