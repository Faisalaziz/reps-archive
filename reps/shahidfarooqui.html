http:&#x2F;&#x2F;barcampmumbai.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;BCM8

About 300 people participated in this Barcamp. I talked about Mozilla projects and promoted its initiative through our stall.

Barcamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from participants.

Barcamp is in essence a free conference without a preset agenda. We prefer the term &#39;unconference&#39; actually. A bunch of smart people meet up over the weekend, put up a schedule on a wall and spend the rest of their time taking up sessions and discussions with each other. </td>
