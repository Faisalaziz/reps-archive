      <td>Mozilla Foundation will be doing field research in India. This research project is about learning how people use the web today. As part of our non profit work at the Foundation, we are creating a product called Webmaker, which aims to turn consumers of the web into creators. The information we collect while traveling will help us understand how we can lower the bar for content creation on the web, and how we can develop programs to drive digital inclusion.</td>
