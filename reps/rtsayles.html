Hello to the people to the people that have signed up as volunteers since my last email.

This is the final reminder that we are holding our &#39;Volunteer Briefing&quot; this very evening at the Mozilla offices in London. This will be your chance to meet (most) of the MozFest core organising team and find out all about the event and how you will be contributing.

We will be (hopefully streaming live video via AirMozilla (we will email the link information later) and will have a back channel for questions through Twitter @MozLDN and also on the #mozfest channel on IRC.

Please do attend if you possibly can - use this form to indicate that you will join us (if you have not already done so). Only sign-up to attend if you truly intend to - spaces are limited and we may well have to close the list if we get too many sign-ups.

Where? Mozilla Office, 101 St Martin’s Lane, Floor 3, London WC2N 4AZ, UK (if you have not been to the Moz office before there are some great step-by-step navigation instructions on the Mozilla Wiki.)

When? Thursday 16th October from 6:30pm (7:00pm start)

Hope to see you later!

Spike

(Volunteer coordinator)
