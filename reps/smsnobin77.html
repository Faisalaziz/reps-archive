  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I'm an active l10n contributor of <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/bn-BD/contributors/" target="new">bn-BD community</a>. From 31st December-2014, I'm active in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MozillaBD/" target="new">Mozilla Bangladesh</a> community.  

My main view is to release Bengali language pack asap for any release of Mozilla products. I want that people can use Mozilla products in Bengali language and get highest feelings from it.

Beside these, I'm a community leader of <a href="https://events.docker.com/dhaka/" target="new">Docker - Dhaka, Bangladesh </a> community. Also I'm working as a freelance web developer at  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/fl/smsarwar" target="new"> Upwork </a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/sarwar96" target="new"> Fiverr. </a>

Like as a Mozillians, I believe in an Open Web where anyone can create, contribute and share. Trying to spread Mozilla's mission and views to the people.

Currently, I'm a M.Sc. student of Computer Science and Engineering at Jahangirnagar University. I have completed my B.Sc. in last year. I have interest in competitive programming, VR, Machine learning, IOT security, Artificial intelligence, blockchain, l10n and open source technology.

Feel free to contact me through email or Knock me at <a href="https://telegram.me/smsnobin77" target="new">telegram</a> if you want to know about me or Mozilla or want to collaborate with me. I will reply you asap.</td></tr>
