* QA News and Events
* This Friday, the 27th of March, starting at 8:00 pm (UTC),  the Mozilla Hispano team will bring an introduction about QA and some  of their procedures. This testday will be coordinated by gaby2300 and Yunito,  two members of our QA Team. The testday will be held in Spanish, so  every Spanish Speaker user will be able to understand all of the stuff  that will be shown.
* Saturday, March 28th, we‚Äôll be hosting Windows 64 bit Nightly. The main focus is going to be testing the Windows 64 bit build of Firefox for Nightly.
* Are you interested in creating a T-shirt for Mozilla QA? You need not be  a professional designer ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to have you try your hand at  creativity and submit your design. You would be part of an awesome  worldwide community and your work would be seen by a lot of people.

* Mailed all my mentees to check for status and ask for feedback about me in 2014 so we can improve our relationship in 2015: &quot;I though that the new year will be a good opportunity to give us a few minutes to see what went ok in the last year but also what we can improve. My goal is to take those and work on them so we will have a better communication, activity and happy people aka me and you :D
How do you see this working following up next?
For ex. One of my concerns is that I am reaching you not as often as it should,. This is a 2 way street meaning that I can start doing it but I would not want to bother you.
How are your expectations from your mentor this year? How can I help you more to be active and happy around Mozilla Reps and its community?
Thanks in advance and let&#39;s hope 2015 will be a great one in all domains, personal and professional too! &quot;

## Important: TOPIC 3 -  ReMo&#x2F;Mozillians Testing (Ioana )
* The most loved portal ( aka Reps portal) and its Big Brother ( aka Mozillians) need some testing love as they do not have owners from employees side.
* In this way our super mega awesome devs ( Tasos and Nemo)  will gain more time on developer side and will implement even more awesomeness. 
* ACTIONS:
* mail&#x2F;tweet me [Ioana] if you are interested (ioana at mozilla.ro &#x2F; @ioana_cis)
* [Ioana] will make an actionable plan with different tasks for everyone ( similar to the Mozillians one made by MattB)
* will contact the UX initiative too 
* RELEVANT LINKS: 
* Already existing testplan for Mozillians: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;secretmustache.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;mozillians-testplan.html
* Look after the meeting:
* Building a team: Ioana, Bebe, Christos, [add yourself]</td>
