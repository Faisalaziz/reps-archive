  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>## Bio

I'm Rub√©n (aka Nukeador), and I've been collaborating with Mozilla community since 2004, from websites' localization to QA, user support, community marketing and organization, events in Spain and IT tasks at [Mozilla Hispano](http://www.mozilla-hispano.org) community.

Currently working on:

* Mozilla Reps Program Manager
* Mozilla Hispano IT coordination.
* Mozilla Reps Council member.
* Mozilla Reps mentor.

## Why a Rep

I'm a Rep as a way to get more involved in the project, its future and to empower other mozillians.

## Office Hours

I am usually available for talking Mon-Fri 9:00 - 12:00 UTC. Ping me via any communication channel you find me on, some of which are listed in this page. If it's important, email is the best way to get my attention.


**Please [use this page](https://calendly.com/nukeador) to request a meeting with me.**</td></tr>
