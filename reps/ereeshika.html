<h1>Amila Ereeshika</h1>

<table>
  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I'm a BSc. in <strong>Computer Science graduate</strong> from University College Dublin. 
Currently, I'm running a company of my own. In the same time, I've engaged freelancing work and volunteer activities.
I've worked with several organizations including Mozilla Sri Lanka Community, FOSS Sri Lanka Community, IEEE Sri Lanka Students Section, and other Local volunteering communities.
I've started my Mozillian life as a firefox student ambassador at NSBM Mozilla firefox club. There I involved with many activities and later became the president of the same club. I've initiated the Mozilla Campus Club of NSBM and became the club captain. After graduation, I started working with Mozilla Sri Lanka community. There I provide my contribution to organize events, mentor Local Campus clubs and other Mozilla related activities as well.</td></tr>
