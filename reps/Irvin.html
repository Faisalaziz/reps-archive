<h1>Irvin Chen</h1>

  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>Liaison of MozTW, Mozilla Taiwan Community.

Love to travel and speak about Mozilla, working every night on local community projects for translate, coordinate, fixing website and read forward news.

Not really well on keeping the community and the job, often get angry when things not work as we claim, but I'll do all my best to try 'til morning.
