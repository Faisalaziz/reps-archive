<h1>Kristi Progri</h1>

<table>
  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I have been involved in FLOSS communities since 2013, where I discovered the wonderful Mozilla Community in Albania also. As someone with a non technical background, contributing to Mozilla has been an inspiring process for me, as I was able to comprehend the vivid world of the open web, where everyone can contribute, regardless of their background.

I became a Mozilla Rep in late 2015, after contributing as a Firefox Student Ambassador since 2014. I'm happy to have had the chance to co-organize Mozilla Weekend events in Berlin and TIrana, intensive 2 day events focused on onboarding new contributors at Mozilla.

Furthermore, I have been part of the organizer committee of Open Source Conference Albania aka OSCAL, since the very first edition in 2014. The experience I gained throughout organizing local and regional events have helped me shape my vision as a Mozillian as well.

Currently, I study International Affairs at the European University of Tirana, Albania which comes in perfectly with my role as a community leader in the Albanian community, helping to grow participation and growth locally.</td></tr>
