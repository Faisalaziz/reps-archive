  <tr><td>Bio</td><td># Bio
Long time Mozilla supporter since Firefox 1.0, member of the Mozilla Venezuela spreading Firefox Awesomess, started as a Mozilla Student Rep at my university [UNEXPO](http://www.bqto.unexpo.edu.ve/) where I'm currently studying Electronic Engineering, Front-End Web Developer, Marketing Maniac and Mozilla Rep & Mentor, promoting the Open Web, FOSS and Tech Culture in Venezuela. 

# What Do I Do?
I'm currently participating on my local community [Mozilla Venezuela](http://www.mozillavenezuela.org/) growing up and empowering the mozillians in venezuela to get them involved more easily, also attending to several events were I give talks and presentations to let other people know about Mozilla, our mission and products. 
I'm active too on the [Mozilla Hispano](http://www.mozilla-hispano.org/) community, helping in the podcast, mentoring new contributors and other areas.
Recently I have been more focused on Firefox Marketing and leading the Mobilizer efforts in Venezuela.
I love what I do, and I'm thankful to Mozilla for helping me to do it!

Former Reps Council Member and current Reps Mentor.

      <td>Mis estimados Padawans,

Ha pasado un largo tiempo desde mi último check-in con ustedes. Desafortunadamente esto sirve como ejemplo de una de las mayores debilidades del programa Reps: El nivel de actividad entre los Mozilla Reps.

Mozilla es una organización enorme que requiere un amplio espectro de actividades de sus colaboradores. Mientras que el programa de Reps ciertamente no es ideal para todo el mundo, estoy seguro de que hay un lugar para que cualquiera pueda contribuir a los objetivos y la misión de Mozilla.

Este correo electrónico es un adelanto de la &quot;Campaña de Actividades de Fin de Año&quot; la cual se dará inicio en breve y sera anunciada en la lista reps-general. La campaña tiene como objetivo separar la parte activa de Mozilla Reps de los inactivos, pudiendo volver a activar aquellos Reps que han estado inactivos (mas de 3 meses sin realizar actividades ni reportes). Aquellos que se encuentren inactivos para el momento de finalizar la campaña se moverán al grupo Reps Alumni (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reps.mozilla.org&#x2F;people&#x2F;alumni&#x2F;).

Personalmente, le doy la bienvenida a esta iniciativa, a pesar del corto aviso, sirve como una forma de averiguar quién aún está dispuesto y capaz de contribuir a los objetivos del programa de Reps.

Por favor, estén atentos a los anuncios oficiales de la Campaña de Actividad y no duden en ponerse en contacto conmigo en caso de tener alguna pregunta, en vista de que se nos hizo complicado tener una reunión entre todos, realizare entonces reuniones individuales con cada quien si así lo prefieren para repasar los detalles de la campaña y&#x2F;o aclarar dudas, pueden apuntar una cita en el siguiente enlace https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;thephoenixbird&#x2F;30min

Saludos cordiales,

In the 2015 edition of FLISoL that took place in Barquisimeto, we had the opportunity for our community to be part of the organizing committee that which much effort provided the best possible event for the participants had an enjoyable learning experience and opportunity to teach us something more.

They were members of the Free Software Users Lara (GUSL) as well as members of different communities as Debian, Canaima GNU &#x2F; Linux, among other presents.

Of course Mozilla staff and volunteers were also present at the event helping and giving lectures to the participants on useful topics such as what types of GNU &#x2F; Linux and derivatives exist, what are the cases where it is desirable to use one or the other, and tips for beginners who want to start in the world of free software.</td>

We had the 9th Firefox Birthday Party with the local mozillians from my city, instead of filling our bellies with candies and sweets we had a more informal lunch with the local supporters in a nice place, we ate a lot of delicious lasagna in a 80&#39;s musical ambient restaurant that the girls suggested.

Sadly due some unexpected issues our specially made Firefox cupcakes didnt make it and some mozillians couldnt attent either.

![SUMMIT1](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm8.staticflickr.com&#x2F;7295&#x2F;11742778764_a128c6636b.jpg &quot;SUMMIT1&quot;)

After lots of planning was done from June 2013 during the Assembly, The Mozilla Summit 2013 resulted in one the biggest events in Mozilla history so far, gathering thousands of Mozillians from all over the world in three locations, Brussels, Santa Clara and Toronto.

![SUMMIT-2](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm4.staticflickr.com&#x2F;3781&#x2F;11742806354_ea4d66ac9c.jpg &quot;SUMMIT-2&quot;)

During three days the Mozillians were asked to think about the Past, Present and Future of Mozilla, and how could we make over One Million Voices be heard on the internet? It was a kind of different conference that you would normally attend as the Mozillians actively participated on it and even held their own talks on it.

![SUMMIT-3](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm8.staticflickr.com&#x2F;7445&#x2F;11742643213_5ea29b84ba.jpg &quot;SUMMIT-3&quot;)

My role during this Summit was being the Master of Ceremonies (MC) for the Toronto location, as such I had to liven up the mood on the attendees and relay on them the daily message of the Summit, keep them updated on the household items and also chat a bit with them informally so they could feel themselves relaxed during the event.

![SUMMIT-31](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm6.staticflickr.com&#x2F;5516&#x2F;11741830653_bd5cabc001.jpg &quot;SUMMIT-31&quot;)

You wont see too many pictures on my own album since I had to be behind scenes all the time, updating my slides until the last minute, and getting in touch with all the activities of the day to relay them to the attendees, yet I’m sure that you will find a few ones on other ones albums. Yet I have to compliment the amazing team behind the scenes: Shez, Winston, Luciana and may others, also the other MC from the other locations, Mary and Tristan, we had to sync our talks to be able to give the same content on all the locations and at the same time be able to modify this on the fly to match the mood of the attendees.

![SUMMIT-5](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm6.staticflickr.com&#x2F;5520&#x2F;11742645864_8ecec1afe5.jpg &quot;SUMMIT-5&quot;)

The Mozillians gave their feedback through the Summit App let the organizers&#x2F;mc&#39;s check the mood, feeling and ideas that could be implemented on the next day, also several group activities let the mozillians meet each other, an opportunity rarely seen in other kind of conferences were you normally talk with the people you know and its hard to meet new people, more difficult if you are in an environment where there are more than 50 different languages spoken.

![SUMMIT-4](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm3.staticflickr.com&#x2F;2813&#x2F;11743009986_25c09c10f9.jpg &quot;SUMMIT-4&quot;)

We also had Open Sessions, were the attendees could previously request a time-slot on a previously prepared room to held a session, another thing that make us different, because we are not only holding a conference for amazing people, but also having those amazing people held their own micro-talks on it, there were so many talks running at the same time that it was quite difficult to attend all of them, but all of them were related to the topics discussed on that same day as the main topic of the day by the principal speakers. We also had a Mozilla Reps session to use this unique opportunity to gather Reps from all over the world and give a talk about How to Become Awesome Community Builders.

For me, this particularly experience on the Summit as the master of ceremonies allowed me to explore another point of view from my Mozilla collaboration experience, on how do we work really hard for the community in order to grow as a more efficient and awesome people with a common goal.

As always, Mozillians know how to Rock Hard in a party.

We had the Software Freedom Day in the city of Valencia, it&#39;s a city that currently has a large group of collaborators helping Mozilla Venezuela efforts to promote Firefox and Firefox OS, the local community Vaslibre decided to organize the SFD on their city with a single topic: Mozilla Technologies.

![SFD13-2](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm6.staticflickr.com&#x2F;5521&#x2F;10585825775_a373854916.jpg &quot;SFD13-2&quot;)

This made a big difference since usually the SFD holds different topics but we decided to make one to show off that Mozilla is not only Firefox, we demoed and talked with all the attendees all the other projects supported by Mozilla and their volunteers.

![SFD13-3](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm3.staticflickr.com&#x2F;2851&#x2F;10585879624_cf20679b69.jpg &quot;SFD13-3&quot;)

The attendees were really excited and bombarded us with questions, is good to see so knowledge hungry people around, indeed having 3 mozilla venezuela members travel all around the country to help on this event was well worth it!</td>

The first Firefox OS Mobilizer Party was held in Caracas a couple of weeks after the official launch, a lot of people joined us, they came even from other cities to join the party and celebrate the launch of FirefoxOS.

The main goal of the Mobilizer Party is to gather all the Mobilizers of the same region and let them know more about Firefox OS.

June was a crazy month, just after arriving from the Firefox OS Camp in Cartagena i jumped into another plane to Caracas to give a talk about Firefox OS in the UCAB during their famous JOINCIC (Science and Technology Congress) about 400 students were sitting there listening to the talks, and during the Firefox OS talk they were listening quietly, i could just look at their bright eyes looking at the slides and paying attention, and after the talk a roar of applauses confirmed that they loved the talk, points about how to develop applications for FxOS, presenting the very first FxOS Keon phone in Venezuela to them was also a shocking point during the talk, they all wanted to know more about it, I finished my presentation introducing the FSA to the students, and told them that i would wait for them outside to sign them up.

Lots of students suddently stood up to leave the room was i went off the stage, so the organizers rushed to tell them that there was still another talk before the break, as always the mozillians rocked hard!

Simultaneously we had the Summit Assembly in order to prepare and lay the massive brainstorm about &quot;what should we discuss on the Summit&quot; to create the &quot;main story&quot; of this event, to make it different, but BIG! We worked so hard for several days to get this done, and my jetlag wasnt helping, but at the end we managed to get it done!

Its good to know that the Mozillian community is growing steadily on this city, also new mozillians joined during this event, this city is important due its closest location to the capital and a high amount of professionals living here dedicated to the tech area, also there are quite a lot of students of mayor universities here too, there is a lot of potential volunteers here and we are going forward to get them involved with the awesomess of mozilla.

In March the whole community of Mozilla Hispano traveled to Lima, Peru to held an annual offline-meeting in order to review the status of the community and look for ways to keep improving.

![MHWorkWeek4](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm9.staticflickr.com&#x2F;8264&#x2F;8667238514_7d37d64cf4.jpg &quot;MHWorkWeek4&quot;)

All the teams and projects that takes place in Mozilla Hispano exposed their work and what are they doing until now, and their future plans, also several brainstorming took place in order to improve those existing projects with fresh ideas and also to look for ways to get people involved more easily into those projects.

![MHWorkWeek2](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;farm9.staticflickr.com&#x2F;8263&#x2F;8666147371_88f26e525c.jpg &quot;MHWorkWeek2&quot;)

There were also actitivies on the strees where mozillians went to meet people in the streets and see if they knew about Firefox and what they like about it. Several videos were recorded to be used for future marketing campaigns and other projects in Mozilla Hispano.

This Work Week was planned more carefully than last year, when it was held together with the MozCampLATAM in order to save costs on flight tickets, but it proved to be the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; to keep this events separated times, since mental exhaustion and fatige kicks in after 2 or 3 days straight, on 2012 the WorkWeek wasnt that productive since all the attendees were very tired due the MozCamp, but this time the productivity of this meeting was about 500%, the work of at least 6 months was done in 3 days :)

Im looking forward to the next year and how much we will improve from now, with the new projects and changes we have already launched on Mozilla Hispano Community.</td>

5 Mozilla Reps were selected to proudly represent the whole Mozilla Community in one of the most important events in Mobile Telecommunications worldwide the **Mobile World Congress (MWC)**, Reps worked together with the rest of the Mozilla Corporation crew as a team, our duty was to give FirefoxOS demos to all the attendees, help others when needed and do what we know to do, show off to everyone that *&quot;Mozilla is not the kind of company they think we are&quot;*

Our whole expectatives were blew up starting from Sunday, when at the press conference we expected 300 media representatives and we had a total of 700 frenzied-hungry-for-info media representatives, newspapers, blogs, and many others, followed to this, the next four days at the Mozilla Booth we were overwhelmed by the hordes of people comming to our booth, extraordinary press coverage from several medias all around the world, there was so much media representatives comming at our booth that the Press team asked us Reps to help and give recorded demos to them, there are a couple of videos of me giving demos link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eTAOS8_7kns but special kudos to the Logistics and IT teams of Mozilla, they were able to put everything together to get all the devices running smootly, wifi online, schedules up to date, etc...

WOW there was so much work done simultaneously in such a short amount of time, it was indeed an amazing experience for us the Community members to live this experience, because in the middle of the chaos, staff and volunteers shared the same passion, devotion and zealous desire to show that FirefoxOS is the way to break down the walls of the two big duopoly&#39;s that exists in the mobile world nowdays. We all together worked so hard, sweating cold, running around in a HUGE event venue, our feets hurt and our throats were tired of giving around 100 demos to people daily mainly in english and also in spanish!

Reps role on the MWC was to show off the community component that no one else has in this heavily business-saturated environment, also having representatives from the main countries where FirefoxOS will be launched was a point to demostrate that the community on those countries is ready to welcome the new era of the mobile world. I think that all the Reps who attended share the same feeling as me, that Mozilla is unique in that moment when all of us work together to bring those ideals we share forward.

In the end we succeded and GREATLY!!!
Everyone in the MWC was talking about FirefoxOS!!!
Everyone in the Web is NOW talking about FirefoxOS!!!

Traveled to Bogotá to participate on the FirefoxOS App Days together with other ReMo, although there was some difficulties with the location, LATAM-Reps PowerTeam allowed the event to go smoothly as planned, attendace was of 68 developers, 11 webapps were created, a ratio of 1:6 apps per developer! The best four apps (third place had a draw) were awarded with a FirefoxOS Developer Phone Voucher. Overall the event was a total success!!!

Started as a **Mozilla Reps Mentor** this month, mentoring new reps to become part of this awesome community of volunteers, responsabilities are greater, lots of work, and it&#39;s also quite time consuming, but it&#39;s also refreshing to know that you are actually building a better Mozilla and a better Web for all of us empowering new volunteers to have the tools they need (and i was given on my time) to grow as powerful Reps all over the World.</td>

After a long trip, I participated on the Refresh Valencia, a forum where invited expositors talk about their knowledge in a 20 minutes session, the goal of this is to &quot;refresh&quot; your knowledge with new information, of course, most of the attending participants are web developers and web designers, also some other students and regulars attended too, the talk went great also we got invited for the next Refresh in 2013.

Mozillians from valencia are quite unique, they are very pro-active, after the event another spontaneous MozCoffee led to talk about future events in the city, the nearest and important one is FLISOL2013, wich of course I have already secured a spot there.

Two weeks later, I visited the city of Valencia, I was invited by the Students of the Free Software Club on the &quot;Antonio José Paez&quot; University (UJAP) to give a talk about Webmaker tools, around 15 students attended the talk and they liked a lot the webmaker tools in particular Thimble, they are planning to translate some examples that they found interesting, and start to hack them.

On the Mozilla Venezuela side, we visited two different universities, the biggest one was a big successful event in the UNET were i met a lot of eager young students in the area of informatics, they were really interested into Firefox OS and a lot of them came to our booth to ask questions about how to get involed in localization, programming and helping. They were leaded into the Get Involved page and i will stay in touch with them to follow up. 

I hope to visit this city soon again, because, due time limitations with the plane tickets itinerary the visit had a really tight agenda, and it didnt allowed me enough time to meet all the students who wanted to get involved and learn a lot more about Mozilla. Im already planning with a few professors of that university to arrange a new event on it shortly.

There is a Mozilla Venezuela Podcast planned for this month, this is new for us and im looking forward on this, i think this is an awesome way to get our members involved and participate a lot more.

New Mozilla Venezuela website should go live definitely on Sept, final touches are ready!</td>

      <td>This month biggest activity was the FudCon Latam 2012 (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) which was held in Venezuela this year on Valencia city, i got invited by Fedora Ambassador &amp; Mentor María &quot;tatica&quot; Leandro to participate as a speaker in the conference, I submitted my proposed talk Firefox OS &quot;La Web es la Plataforma&quot; and it got approved and scheduled for Friday 24th sessions, I spoke about Hackasaurus, Firefox for Android and then the main focus Firefox OS and how it was developed, I showed up some examples using the desktop emulator. Many of the attendees were students from local universities but also there were developers in the crowd who got interested into the features and power of Firefox OS, developers asked interesting questions and they got answered correctly, many of them were doubtful about how Google and Apple would react to the Mozilla Marketplace as a open market, yet we answered their questions with the usual Mozilla style: &quot;In Mozilla we like when people tell us that our goal is impossible, because it makes us work even harder.&quot;

After our talk we found that several attendees couldnt join our session since they were on other sessions at the same time, or they didnt want to interrupt us so they wouldnt open the door. So i spoke with the organizers and scheduled another session by popular request on Saturday 25th, I didnt want it to look exactly as the previous one so i wore a hat (LOL)

We also had our Mozilla Booth in place during the rest of the time, speaking with people and looking for feedback from FF users, also we instructed them on how to install Firefox for Android, there were some developers that approached us as well and we showed them the new cool features on Firefox 15 like the Javascript Sandbox, Javascript Debugger, Code Inspector and the new Responsive Design View.

I would also like to mention the great support and hospitality of the Vaslibre Community in Valencia, they are a small group of free software activists on this city, but they are very active and helpful, they participated as volunteers for the whole FudCon, and also they showed up interest into participating and helping Mozilla in future events, i instructed them to join our community and start planning future events on their city, i like this city, it has a lot of raw potential, there are 3 big universities here housing thousands of students on areas like computers and software engineering.

Yet I had time to work at home in other areas, for example the new template for the website of Mozilla Venezuela: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;w2843.jpg This theme is based on another one called Yoko (GPL) with features from OneMozilla (By Craig Cook) and following the MOZ Communities Style Guide, its fully made with HTML5&#x2F;CSS3&#x2F;Javascript in order to show off the Mozilla Ideals of how to build a safer and faster web using standards, the site layout is responsive so it will adapt to any screen size (mobile ones too), this theme is going to be reviewed by the MozVE community and its planned to be deployed in our website on the first week of August2012.

      <td>June was another great month too, I had two presentations on different universities, one being on my own &quot;Alma máter&quot; the UNEXPO and another one in an important university on this region wich focuses on computer related education, the Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado (UCLA). 

First was the presentation on my university, since most of the public are professional engineers or students of this career I decided to create new slides for this one, and with the help of Nukeador (Ruben Martin) and Philipp von Weitershausen, I have created &quot;Mozilla the Web is the Platform&quot; slides, it introduces to HTML5, WebApps, Marketplace and Firefox OS (B2G), the almost 300 attendees reception was totally awesome and it was really satisfactory for me.

Then next day I had another presentation on a another near university the Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado (UCLA), with almost 400 attendees mainly students from the same university, we took the &quot;Mozilla: De Todos Para Todos&quot; slides for them and everything went perfect, they also awarded me with a commemorative diploma!!!

      <td>April was a tought month, it had a lot of stuff on it, first was the MozCamp LATAM 2012 held in Buenos Aires, it was an amazing experience, meet a lot of mozillians from all over latin america, i want to see them all again soon, so lets keep working hard!

Just after MozCamp we had FLISoL event on April 28th, it&#39;s the biggest free software installation festival held on LATAM on several countries on the same day, we held a Mozilla Booth and a talk on the main event: Mozilla: de todos para todos! were I spoke about Mozilla history, what we did in the past, what are we doing now and what we are going to do in the future, MozCamp was a great source of information since I added information to this talk about the Boot2Gecko project and people was really interested on it, also we reminded everyone that Mozilla is a non-profit organization and its 99% workforce comes from volunteers around the world (like me) that love the open web. Although the attendance to the event was not really near the expected, past year FLISoL had about 500 people, this year they barely had 150 attenders, I think it was due the lack of advertising of the event and also another factor was that the university had no activities that day, so students didn&#39;t pass by to peek in. But we had a lot of positive feedback in our booth, where the attenders showed interest in the swag (they thought that we were selling it, but when they realized that we were giving it away for free, they swarmed in) and also they automatically recognized the Mozilla brand, they knew us and they asked some questions on issues they had in the past with Firefox.

Some pictures of the event, the rest will be posted on my Facebook and Google+ accounts:

Also, i had confirmations to both of my talks on the FLISOL 2012 on 28th of April (just after MozCamp!) and CNSL on May 11th, i have spoken with the coordinators of the events and i have secured the morning spots for my talks to get the most people possible to assist.

The FLISOL 2012 will be held on the Yacambu University, on Cabudare (abou 30 mins driving from my city) on the same state [1] and the CNSL 2012 will be held on the &quot;Flower of Hannover&quot; wich is a eco-friendly cultural museum with an auditorium with a capacity for 3000 people! the place is surrounded with gardens of orchids (i will take tons of pictures of this) here is a picture of the auditorium inside on the past CNSL2010 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lh3.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;-Gxe7EJz5nY0&#x2F;Tgpbd17IMLI&#x2F;AAAAAAAAAFo&#x2F;fsCEt2HxXTg&#x2F;s1024&#x2F;CNSL6-10.jpg

This small event was great for me, since i was able to confirm my skills and polish my speech for the upcoming events on April&#x2F;May.

Also i was able to meet other two members of Mozilla Venezuela during this event, they are quite active on the mailing list so we used this event to meet each other, talk about MozVe and future projects. </td>

As mentioned before i was invited to attend to the Hacking Day 111111 as a expositor in the city of Acarigua in Venezuela, i quickly got my bagpack and slides prepared to travel in bus, i got some slides prepared for it http:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpad.org&#x2F;thephoenixbird&#x2F; since many of the attenders were students, i focused my presentation into introducing Mozilla Foundation, Mozilla Firefox, its features and how to contribute as developers joining an existing community, there was a previous talk about HTML5 so it was easy to introduce the whole presentation as it was made on HTML5&#x2F;CSS3, the public was surprised to see the slides running inside Firefox 8 (just released!) and watching the source code for all, i even gave them the source code of the slides so they could experiment with it.

It was my first time giving a full presentation, it was a really gratificating experience, im looking forward to do it again and even better!!!

      <td>As expected August was a really busy month for me, studing for the last exams took all my time, yet i managed to scratch a few hours from my schedule in order to attend to the 7th Debian Day in my city on a local university UCLA (Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado) organized by the Debian Community of said university, there i was able to meet interesting people, some of then that i had already met on the previous CNSL and now i had more time to introduce them into MozillaVenezuela to join us, i had time to chat with the attenders about the recent release of Firefox 6 and the new version for Android phones! Photos of the event at the end of the report.

Also, found that my writting skills are of good use, when i have some time i write a couple of articles about the most recent news, just got one published in Mozilla-Hispano, hope to write more of them and get them published both in MozillaVenezuela and Mozilla-Hispano. </td>

      <td>During August wich seems to be a very busy month for me (end of semester at the university, last exams stress) im looking foward to recruit a few more friends at my local community, to get them involved, not just to iddle and read the mailinglist but to reply, ask, and encourage them to post their ideas on the wall, also i got a word from a friend that Debian Day is comming and they will have cake for the attenders, wonder if they will let me join :P </td>

      <td>June ended with my attendance to the National Congress of Free Software here on my city, there i met a lot of interesting people and had time to speak with the attenders, many of them didnt knew that Firefox 5 was released at that time and introduced them to the new features it had, i joined into MozillaVenezuela Community unifying all the Moz Reps in a single community in order to coordinate our activities and grow up as a team to spread Firefox in our country.

During the rest of July things werent so much active as i was still on semester at the university so between exams and laboratory duties i writed some articles about Mozilla to get published on MozillaVenezuela.org some of them got into the front page and a few ones still needs some review from the rest of the members.

Im used to go to the university with my Firefox&#x2F;Mozilla T-Shirts, i think of it as a great &quot;passive way&quot; to promote Firefox on my campus, since people always ask me how did i got this shirts and if im related to Mozilla&#x2F;Firefox im always open to reply their questions and introduce them to MozillaVenezuela Community.

Im looking foward into to more in the next month! </td>
