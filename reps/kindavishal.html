Internet Health, Mental Health, Inclusion and Diversity, and Internet Governance are few among the core values that make Mozilla and it&#39;s communities what it is. As we start a fresh new year with new dawns and dusks, it&#39;s time we give equal importance to these topics as we&#39;ve given to every other in our daily life.</td>
