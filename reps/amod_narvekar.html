<h1>Amod Narvekar</h1>

<table>
  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering from an autonomous institute named V.J.T.I. My passion is to do something different than what usually people around me prefer to do. Contributing to open source is my hobby since it raises the skill level and teaches the professional code of conduct and ethics while interacting with people across the world. I had been a part of many Mozilla events and also represented Mozilla in many open source meetups. I had been successfully projecting Mozilla in SFD(Software Freedom Day) since two years. I am blessed with wonderful parents who have supported me in every stage of life. The blessings of my parents, teachers, well-wishers and my friends act as an encouragement and a driving force to make myself even more better.</td></tr>
