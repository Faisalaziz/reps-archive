I am a systems engineer, I am a member of the Mozilla community since 2012

Participate in the group of student ambassadors for the mozilla community, when I was a student at the university

In the local community of Mozilla I have organized events to promote mozilla firafox as a browser for excellence, I also participate in international events such as ECSL, Fundcon, Worcamp, to promote the community, its mission and vision about freedom on the web.

I am currently collaborating in the translation and support group in translating the documentation into the Spanish language, in the platforms of Sumo and Pontoon.

I also work in Advocacy campaigns, generating content and currently translating the Privacy Month Campaing tips to be posted in Mozilla Hispano's Twitter account, so our LATAM Community can share and implement them

I really liked participating in the mozilla AQ group and I am collaborating in the testday for firefox version. I am a faithful collaborator of the project of common voices, I am among the top 10 in the top of validation for the Spanish language

I am an active contributor in sumo and I always participate in the sprint campaign.</td></tr>
