Data Scientist, Software Enginner at Cisco, FOSS contributor and Mozilla Rep

## About History:

I still remember when I was in school 8th Standard, say ~13 years back, we were to write small HTML snippets. I used to use a lot of Netscape Navigator browser and then in a year or so, there was this browser named Firefox which I heard a lot. I have that curious mind, which never rests. That was when I started using Firefox. Few years passed, I then thought myself JS. It was(and is) one of the languages I admire(not just code)! That passion for JS & Mozilla grew over years. I explored about Mozilla's History, Present and thought I should be a part of their Future.
Attending every event, contributed as much as I could with that knowledge in those days. Then, got a chance to showcase Mozilla, Firefox, Firefox OS, Gecko in a bigger stage/audience. Have enjoyed the journey all along. Would like to take the next step officially and see what more I could do being a part of this amazing community.
