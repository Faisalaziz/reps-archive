      <td>First Community meetup of Mozilla Azerbaijan.

Answered question about Mozilla, specially FirefoxOS, Privacy, Firefox Australis.

Then we discussed about localization of Mozilla products. We made a list of users who wants to test Localized Aurora version of Firefox and Mozilla website.

Also we discussed about platforms where we will work:

* For chatting between community members about events, planning and etc we will use IRC channel #mozillaz

* As our users are not filling comfortable with irc, for community online meetups we will use Google Hangouts.

* For reporting Localization errors firstly we decided to use bugzilla and github page, but users asked to use Google Docs, so I will open form for such reports.

* We are going to finish 1st goal of translation of Firefox this month. And also web files for mozilla.org . As soon as we will finish them, we will send notification to our testers.

* For technical support we didn&#39;t decided what to use for now. We will ask users to vote, stackoverflow like website in local language, integrating with currect Q&amp;A website of our country, social network, email list.


Users were happy for this event and asked for offline event in Baku. We are planning to make event where we will explain how to develop application for FirefoxOS and put it in Firefox Marketplace.</td>
