They were all agree with me that Mozilla is doing a good job with this OS and that walled gardens of contents are limiting our freedom. Also, I tried again to propose a talk in my local developers group, but I didn&#39;t win the poll because thery preferred another talk; there is interest in Firefox OS, so I hope to give soon a talk about it in my local developers group. I wrote also some posts in my blog about Firefox OS; I did an unboxing when I received the Keon and then I posted some news about Firefox OS. During this month I also tried to improve my English thanks to Rosetta Stone provided by Mozilla; it is a very useful software and I hope that it will help me to improve my English knowledge. Last, I tried to spread Mozilla related news and things on social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+</td>
