  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>> I work as an Intel® [@AI4Youth](https://twitter.com/AI4Youth) Trainer. I’m a Community Ninja who loves to help people out and Mentor people towards their desired goals. I truly believe in Work Open Lead Open. I love building Communities! I help them implement campaigns and contribute to the mission that Mozilla has. I’m very passionate for the Web, which stays with us in sickness and health.
