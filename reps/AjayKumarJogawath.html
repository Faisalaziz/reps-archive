      <td>This time, i have organized a Community Meetup with Warangal Mozillians, where are all the active and core contributors are invited to make the future planning of Mozilla Warangal.

First we have an introductory session, where all the attendees have introduced to everyone. Later, i gave the clear idea of the reason why we all have gathered.

The Main aim of this meetup was to boost up all the existing mozillians in the community as well as recruiting new contributors. From the past few events going on in Jayamukhi Firefox Clubs and Mozilla Club BIES, students from other colleges have been requesting us to inaugurate Firefox Clubs in their colleges. But there is no particular team and everyone is contributing in random projects. So, i have made four teams and assigned one mentor for each team so that the mentor will be guiding the new contributors in the particular project.
