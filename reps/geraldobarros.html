Instead of working with hypothetical arguments or problem sets, we engage real-world problems and work together on proposed solutions. Design Thinking taps into abilities we all have, but often overlook using conventional problem-solving practices.  

This fast-paced workshop will take you through a single design cycle.  Innovating with a bias towards people, we’ll work in partners to develop a solution to ‘redesign my schedule’ . You’ll  improve your capacity to imagine, assess and put into practice ideas that push forward innovation through early sharing of ideas, ideation and action - experimenting, testing and sharing.

We hope you’ll have fun and take away some basic principles of Design Thinking that you can use in your personal life, and as part of the Campus Campaign Technology Challenge.</td>
