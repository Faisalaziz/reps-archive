  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>I've been helping Mozilla since a long time now. I started translating with Guillermo Movia and Marcelo Poli, then helping Juan Becerra with prerelease QA for a long time. Then I knew about the Mozilla Hispano Community and was asked to join and create the QA Area which I did and became it's Leader. We have a lot of active projects and contributors.
I went to Mozilla Hispano's WorkWeek in Lima, Perú and I was invited to Mozilla's Summit in Toronto, Canada during 2013. During 2014 I went to Mozilla Hispano's WorkWeek in Madrid, Spain and I was invited to QA Mozilla's Workweek in Mountain View, California.
I am a Psychologist, I work at the place where driver's licences are issued since March 1997.
I am also an English into Spanish translator. I work for FDM since November 2007, doing software descriptions translations.
I speak Spanish as my mother tongue and English almost like a native.</td></tr>

Comment
It was a really excellent event! Pablo talked about all the items described above in a very clear way. He explained several procedures regarding Firefox OS and he showed a very interesting app available for Firefox OS and also for Desktop. Lots of questions were asked and he answered them all very nicely and consistently. 
After the talk was finished, I chatted for a while with one of the attendees about the Flame device I have for QA testing, it&#39;s excellent features and some of it&#39;s flaws. He seemed interested in testing, so I referred him to Mozilla&#39;s Moztrap tests.</td>

Marcia gave me the phone when I went to QA Mozilla&#39;s WorkWeek in Mountain View last July. When she gave it to me our goal was that I would use it as my primary phone and I would test all she considered necessary and useful. Unfortunately, the phone powered off by it&#39;s self very often so I couldn&#39;t use it, that&#39;s why the exchange was arranged. I told him I had had a lot of issues trying to flash another FFOS version using Windows. I also told him that by the time I had succeeded, thanks to a mozillian that created a special Windows build for me, I received an email from Asa Dotzler saying all Flame users had to update to a new base image. Some of these users quickly reported the new base image was very buggy so I didn&#39;t even attempt to update, moreover knowing I would have to flash the special build again! I happily gave Guillermo the phone and I&#39;ll be looking very much forward receiving a brand new one, hopefully flawless and updated! 
We talked about how I should start organizing events as a Rep, Guillermo told me about the budget requests and the swag request I would have to ask for and the correct procedures for both. He also told me I should start thinking about organizing an event or giving a talk.
He also told me about 2 future probable local events, one at a college where other Reps and&#x2F;or mozillians maybe would give talks. The other was a kind of Argentinian Workweek during a weekend in a nearby town.</td>

I entered the September 30 one because it was the first one I participated in after I was accepted as a Mozilla Rep.
