  <tr><td>Bio</td><td>## Twitter Bio
Lean product delivery aficionado. #Agile evangelist. Building Dignity volunteer. @ebbf comms advocate. Leading Mozilla's Open Innovation Participation Systems team.

## Reason for being a Mozilla Rep
I have been a fan of Mozilla ever since the Milestone Releases in 1999. Having attended the [Mozilla 1.0 Release Party in Quito](http://www.schnitzer.at/mozparty/?all=true#42) (Ecuador), I decided to host a [Firefox 1.0 Release Party in Munich](http://web.archive.org/web/20050206171150/http://carishina.net/henrik/blog/?postid=64) (Germany).

In 2010 I participated in the Drumbeat Festival in Barcelona and am part of the Webmaker community ever since.

My main contribution to Mozilla is in the area of community building with a regional focus German-speaking countries.

I became a Mozilla Rep in June 2011 and am a Reps Mentor since November that year.

Subject: Heads-Up: Mozilla Reps Activity Campaign

Dear Mozilla Reps Mentees,

it&#39;s been a too long time since my last check-in with you. Unfortunately
this serves as an example for one of the Reps program&#39;s biggest
weaknesses: Level of activity among Mozilla Reps.

Mozilla is a huge organization requiring a broad spectrum of activities
from its contributors. While the Reps program is certainly not perfectly
suited for everybody, I am sure there is a spot for anybody to
contribute to Mozilla&#39;s goals and mission.

This email is a heads-up for the &quot;Activity Campaign&quot; which will be
kicked-off soon. The campaign aims at separating active Mozilla Reps
from inactive ones, potentially re-activating dormant Reps. Those who
are found to be inactive by the time the campaign ends will be moved to
the Reps Alumni group (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reps.mozilla.org&#x2F;people&#x2F;alumni&#x2F;).

Personally, I welcome this initiative. It serves as a way to figure out
who is still willing and able to contribute towards the program&#39;s goals.

Please watch out for the official announcements of the Activity Campaign
and do not hesitate to contact me in case you have any questions.

Best regards,
Henrik
Mozilla Reps Mentor</td>
